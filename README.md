# Welcome 👋, I'm Philippe

### Data Scientist in the Public Sector · Policy Evaluation · Fraud Detection · Shiny Developer

I’m a data scientist based in France, working mainly with **large administrative datasets** to support **public policy evaluation**, **fraud detection** and **public finance analysis**.  
I enjoy turning messy data into decision-ready insights and building **interactive tools (R Shiny / Python)** for non-technical users.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 **Current focus**:  
  Building **Shiny applications** for data exploration, monitoring and reporting in a public-sector context (evaluation, oversight, audits, HR, dashboards).

- 🌱 **Learning & curiosity**:  
  Deepening my knowledge of **cybersecurity**, **data protection**, and how **human factors / social engineering** interact with technical systems.

- 👯 **Open to collaborate on**:  
  Projects related to **data science**, **OSINT (open-source intelligence)**, risk analysis, or tools that help **evaluate public policies**.

Some public-facing projects (most of my work is internal to public institutions):

- **ThesisR** – [Demo](https://l023aq.shinyapps.io/thesesfr/)  
  Interactive analysis of PhD theses defended in France since 1985 (disciplines, institutions, trends over time), with exploratory work on weak signals in sensitive fields.

- **CIR – Contrats d’intégration républicaine** – [Demo](https://l023aq.shinyapps.io/minintCIR/)  
  Shiny app to visualise the main characteristics of Republican Integration Contracts and help analyse integration pathways.

- **SignalConso Explorer** – [Demo](https://l023aq.shinyapps.io/shinySignalConso/)  
  Exploration of consumer reports from the SignalConso platform, with filters and charts to detect recurring issues and patterns.

- **VulnGovTracker** *(access on request)*  
  Monitoring of public servants’ exposure to known data breaches using the **Have I Been Pwned** database, for awareness-raising and cyber risk reduction in public organisations.
